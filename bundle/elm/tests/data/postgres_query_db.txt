This chapter identifies: \n\n\nâ€¢ Strategies for increasing equity in new and used light-duty electric vehicle (EV) adoption and \nEV charging infrastructure distribution, focused on household used EV ownership and home \ncharging access \n\n\nâ€¢ Affordable, energy efficient, and equitable multimodal electrified transportation options, \nspecifically considering the non-vehicle-owning population.', 0.5045672534007773, 'LA100 Equity Strategies.

For \nvarious equitable EV charging infrastructure distribution configurations, we can investigate who \nis benefiting from that EV charging infrastructure, which was not addressed in the original \nLA100 study.  \n\n\nMultimodal Transportation: Beyond Privately Owned Vehicles \nAdditional output metrics about travel modes other than privately owned vehicles are included, \nsuch as transportation energy-related expenditures of using non-driving modes, peoplesâ€™ usage of \nnon-driving modes, and the potential electricity demand of providing multimodal transportation \nservices to DACs. \n\n\nMultimodal transportation-related output metrics provide a broader picture of the transportation \nmobility status of DACs. Improving transportation services to currently disadvantaged \ncommunities requires collaborative efforts from multiple city agencies in addition to LADWP. \nThe City and County of Los Angeles also have goals and pathways identified for achieving more \nequitable transportation services.', 0.5150472083190698, 'LA100 Equity Strategies.

The scope for improvement of the analysis includes: \n\n\n• Sequencing of Electrification of Different Truck Vocations: There are many different vocations of \nheavy-duty trucks, and each will have differing electrification potential and charging needs. Some \nmay offer more cost-effective opportunities for electrification, charging cycles more amenable to \nexisting distribution system capacity, etc. These differences could be investigated to propose a \nstrategic sequencing of electrification of certain vocations, for instance within LADWP’s and other \ncity agency fleets. \n\n\n• Buses: Our analysis also did not consider buses because they are not included in the SCAG travel \ndemand database. Yet, buses (city transit buses, school buses and tour buses) are heavy-duty vehicles \nand qualify for the Charge Up LA! program incentives and goals. Furthermore, the LA100 study \nassumed that all school and urban transit buses would be electrified by 2030 (Hale et al. 2021).', 0.5175034819911801, 'LA100 Equity Strategies. Chapter 11: Truck Electrification for Improved Air Quality and Health', 'Vikram Ravi, Yun Li, Garvin Heath, Isaias Marroquin, Megan Day, Julien Walzberg', '2023'), ('8f0c4221-1710-4381-b084-c9afc4dd8a53', 'It may also be important to evaluate how declining demand for \ngasoline could introduce new opportunities for alternative fuel production at existing refineries. \nNote that there would be additional air pollution-related benefits to the residents of LA from \nindustry fuel switching, electrification, and energy efficiency improvements.  \n\n\n2.1.4 Clean Transportation  \nVarious solutions are being developed and deployed to decarbonize transportation across all \nmodes, ranging from scooters and cars to public transit and airplanes. Transportation is a critical \nelement of any decarbonization strategy and a key lever to reduce air pollution, not by reducing \noverall mobility but by increasing affordable clean mobility options. \n\n\nElectrification of on-road vehicles is only one aspect; additional technologies including \nelectrolytic hydrogen and sustainable biofuels can also contribute, especially for off-road modes. \nAssessing the options most appropriate for LA, and that reflect planning across sectors \n(including industry and power), remains an area for future analysis. For example, LA100 focused \non just personal light-duty vehicles and buses, but analysis could consider additional loads from \nother vehicle types as well as hydrogen production for transportation (and other uses).  \n\n\nIn looking forward, planners could consider vehicles and mobility beyond what exists today. \nWhile passenger vehicles today are predominantly personally owned, in the future they may be \nshared, or operated in a Mobility-as-a-Service model (fleets or ride-hailing vehicles).', 0.5195402022448252, 'The Los Angeles 100% Renewable Energy Study (LA100): Chapter 12.
