INFRA-COMPASS Demo Run
**********************

This directory contains an example configuration intended to get you up an running as quickly as possible.
To execute this run, set up your own OpenAI key (make sure you have at least $0.50 or so available for API
calls), and then tun the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your API key>"; compass process -c config.json5

Alternatively, you can run this demo using ``pixi``:

.. code-block:: shell

    pixi run openai-solar-demo "<your API key>"
