# Linux troubleshooting (landing)

This page points to Linux-specific troubleshooting files. Create per-issue markdown files in this directory and follow the frontmatter template in `index.md`.

Examples to consider:

- package manager issues (apt/yum) for Poppler/Tesseract
- Python wheel compatibility (GLIBC/C++ ABI) problems

Add new entries as focused, reproducible files; avoid duplicating canonical installation docs.
