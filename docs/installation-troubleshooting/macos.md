# macOS troubleshooting (landing)

This page points to per-issue troubleshooting files for macOS. Maintain each issue as a separate markdown file under `docs/installation-troubleshooting/` and follow the frontmatter template in `index.md`.

Current macOS entries

- `macos-poppler-build.md` — Poppler build failure: missing macOS SDK headers
- `macos-poppler-runtime.md` — Poppler runtime missing binaries
- `macos-tesseract.md` — Tesseract not found at runtime

Add new macOS entries by creating a new file in this directory using the frontmatter template in `index.md`. Keep entries concise and diagnostic-first.
